# Machine-Learning-for-Predicting-Type-2-Diabetes-and-Cardiovascular-Diseases
In today's world, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are becoming increasingly common, affecting millions of people globally. These conditions often develop over time due to a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and dietary factors. Early detection and prevention are crucial in reducing their long-term impact on health and quality of life.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and CVD based on various health indicators. These include blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol and lipid profiles, BMI, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits such as diet and physical activity. By analyzing these factors, the model will help identify individuals at higher risk, allowing for early interventions and better disease management.

A key focus of this research is to explore how dietary choices, particularly a low-fat diet, influence the development of hyperinsulinemiaâ€”a condition where the body produces too much insulin. Since hyperinsulinemia is closely linked to insulin resistance, which is a stepping stone to Type 2 diabetes, understanding this relationship is essential. Additionally, excessive insulin levels may contribute to cardiovascular complications, making it even more important to study the effects of diet on overall metabolic health.

By applying machine learning techniques, this project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and risk factors, providing valuable insights for both individuals and healthcare professionals. The ultimate goal is to support personalized healthcare by offering data-driven recommendations on diet and lifestyle adjustments that could help prevent or delay the onset of these chronic diseases.

At its core, this research is about empowering people with the knowledge and tools they need to take charge of their health before problems arise. With the right interventions at the right time, we can work toward a future where fewer people have to face the burdens of diabetes and heart disease.
